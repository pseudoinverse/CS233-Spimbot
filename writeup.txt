Initially, we had tried random number generator strategy. But it turns up that we don't have 70 points in 3 of 4 given map seeds. Rather than improve the random number generator, we tried to set a fixed bonk angle and just let the bot run. Luckily, it satisfies the requirement of scoring at least 70 points total across on 3 of 4 given map seeds. So, we just leave it like this and choose rather not to add any minibot. Besides, we make our program to first solve 10 puzzles before the bot starts to run and pick up corns.
